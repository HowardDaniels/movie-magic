# movie-magic

This application allows the user to find movies and fellow movie buffs (called "buddies") based on information they provide in a form which is accessed upon signing up or logging in.

Once the user's top 3 favorite movies, actors, directors, and movie genres are entered, the user consents to being searchable by fellow movie buffs, and then submits the form.

Upon submitting the form, users see descriptions of their favorite movies, recommended movies based on their favorite movies, actors, directors, and genres, and buddies whose tastes in movies are closest to those of the user.

This application uses OMDB API to search movie data, as well as MySQL to store user data in a database.
